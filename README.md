# Train-Unloading-Dock-Simulation

A Python/SimPy written program written from scratch to simulate 72,000 hours of a Train Unloading Dock Station.  
It takes into consideration real life variables such as delays in train arrival times, train crew working hours, idle times, operating hours and multiple other factors.    
This was one of my first bigger scale projects and required a good understanding of mathematical, analytical and programming concepts.
